## Mission Statement: 
Reimagine what it means to “budget” and take control of your own spending. 

## Problem:
Ask any person if they feel like they have enough money, and there is a good chance the answer will be “no”, regardless of how much money they make. There are many ways to make more money, but that doesn’t appear to be the problem. The trouble people have with budgeting isn’t about numbers, but about behavior. Usually, when people suggest changing how you spend money, the first solution that comes to mind is budgeting; sit down, write out a tedious and detailed plan with categories your grandparents used and decide how much you want to allot to each one over a year or month. This solution is front-loaded, abstract, antiquated, and unapproachable. We want to re-imagine the solution space to require minimal onboarding, to meet modern user needs, and to encourage users to achieve goals that feel attainable, immediate and concrete.
