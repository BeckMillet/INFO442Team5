## Prioritization of Qualities
| Rank | Quality          | Justification                                                                                                                                              |
|------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User Efficiency  | Efficient interaction and onboarding are what differentiates this system from traditional budgeting.                                                       |
| 2    | Performance      | If we design the UX to make it efficient for users, it follows that we must also design the code such that program operation is not slowing down the user. |
| 3    | Learnability     | Our product emphasizes minimal onboarding and simplicity to make budgeting more approachable. The program must be easy for users to learn how to use.      |
| 4    | Privacy          | How you spend money can be personal and socially sensitive information.                                                                                    |
| 5    | Usefulness       | The user should feel like the system contributes to their day-to-day life, otherwise, they will not use the system in their day-to-day.                    |
| 6    | Usability        | The user experience should be seamless without hindrances.                                                                                                 |
| 7    | Accessibility    | Accessibility is always good for a market product. In the case of this product, it will be straightforward to implement machine readability.               |
| 8    | Consistency      | The narrow number of use cases makes consistency baked in but not critical.                                                                                |
| 9    | Robustness       | The limited number of entry points makes this easy and important to design for.                                                                            |
| 10   | Verifiability    | Due to the purported behavior-changing goal of the product, verifying success is done on a personal level.                                                 |
| 11   | Reliability      | Programs that crash frequently and are programs that are frustrating to use                                                                                |
| 12   | Correctness      | The dynamic nature of the classroom learning environment warrants high flexibility and willingness to diverge and improve on specifications.               |
| 13   | Reusability      | Good code should be inherently reusable, but the scope of this project will not warrant a major emphasis on it.                                            |
| 14   | Maintainability  | The intended life of the system is short-lived(a quarter).                                                                                                 |
| 15   | Security         | Most security features will be outsourced to the user device setting, local network connection, or baked into the database infrastructure.                 |
| 16   | Interoperability | Automated integration with bank accounts(ex mint) is not something we will design for as manual entry is intended to promote autonomy and growth.          |
| 17   | Portability      | Intended to be used on mobile(desktop use cases lack unique benefit).                                                                                      |
