# Plan
## Coordination
PM will coordinate meetings. CEO will coordinate development work. 

**Biweekly Meeting Schedule**
- Monday: Demo and debugging.
- Wednesday: Divide work and work on product development.

**Meeting Agenda:**
- PM publishes the meeting agenda in advance and takes notes during team activities.
- Stand-up for individuals to update the team on their task progression, ask questions, and notify roadblock concerns. 
- Prepare for the upcoming week by reviewing incomplete issues and deadlines.
- Divide up work and review schedules to ensure each member understands his/her task and has sufficient time, expertise, and resources for completion.
- PM adds action items as issues on Github and assigns team members to relevant tasks. 

## Communication
**Slack:** General questions, update on workflow, and sharing of resources. Possible alternatives included Facebook Messaging, Skype, and Discord, but we felt that the class integration of Slack, our easiness working with the platform from previous experiences, and its compatabilities with Zoom (/Zoom to start meeting) and GIFs make it the best and most straightforward option.

**Github:** Access to project files and issues for progress tracking. 

**Google Team Drive:** Access to meeting notes, homework files, and lab activities.

## Ownership
We decided to split up the workflow based on each member's role and familiarity with implementing the components. This process allowed our members to be mindful and accountable of the parts that they have control over.
