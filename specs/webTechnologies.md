Lab 4: Choosing Technologies

Our team has decided to leverage the technologies in our toolkit from client-side development such as React, Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This will help us be on the same page when it comes to development decisions so everyone has a similar understanding. We are also using npm and Firebase for authentication. If we pursue our flex requirements we will use Firebase for our backend.
